# Shopify-Monitor

Was showing my friend how to make a shopify monitor quickly, took around 20 mins, but the basic premise is the same, this monitors for new products. You can change the base url if you would like to monitor a different shopify site & it will still work, Feel free to PR in for any improvements - was not done in async as just wanted to show him the basics of requests.

Usage:

add proxies (ip:port:user:pass), then go into the code and change the webhook url you wish to send the new product to, and then run app.py. Hope this helps someone :-)
